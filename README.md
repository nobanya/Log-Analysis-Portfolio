# Log-Analysis-Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity portfolio repository! This repository contains hands on projects designed to learn and practice essential cybersecurity skills, focusing on vulnerability management, incident response, and log analysis.

## Introduction

As organizations continue to rely heavily on digital infrastructure, cybersecurity has become an essential competency for IT and security professionals. The projects in this repository are designed to provide a guided, hands on learning experience that bridges theory and practice. Each project contains clear instructions, structured exercises, and expected results to help learners progressively develop confidence and technical proficiency.

## About Me

As a SOC Analyst, I presented my projects by showing how I combined real world defensive skills with practical, hands on learning, both in my own work and in the training experiences I shared with others. Connect with me for more updates and resources:

This work is intended to be shared with recruiters and hiring managers as evidence of hands on experience rather than purely theoretical knowledge.
